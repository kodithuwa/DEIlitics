**Challenge** 

As a fully remote and internationally diverse team, AddSearch faces unique challenges in promoting collaboration and inclusivity across different time zones, cultures, and communication styles. These dynamics occasionally lead to misunderstandings, hesitancy in providing feedback, and slowed work progress. Addressing these challenges requires a deeper understanding of DEI principles and innovative approaches to raising awareness within the organization and its operations.
The hackathon task invites participants to explore how AddSearch can raise awareness of DEI issues to:
 + Improve internal collaboration and communication among team members with diverse cultural and professional backgrounds. 
 + Forward an inclusive workplace culture that encourages open dialogue and psychological safety.
 + Demonstrate leadership in DEI practices within the tech industry, inspiring other SMEs to follow suit.

Provide a tangible solutions on how to you facilitate effective collaboration within the team that is working in a above-described way. Please suggest processes, rituals, or programs that a companyâ€™s CEO who is leading the team would adopt to ensure seamless collaborations and workflow.
